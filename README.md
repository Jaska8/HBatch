# HBatch.sh
Simple batch bash script for HandBrakeCLI. Takes input folder and encodes to output folder keeping filenames.

You need to have HandBrakeCLI installed. Works only on linux based machines.

Script is relatively safe as it will not overwrite any files (Creates HBatch.log file for inspection) and all input files will be left untouched!

Usage: ./HBatch.sh or bash HBatch.sh
